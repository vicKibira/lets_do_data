# Data Warehouse Development README

## Overview

This repository contains the development process and artifacts for building a data warehouse. The data warehouse is designed to store and manage data related to customers, channels, products, dates, purchase history, and visit history.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `models/`: Contains YAML files defining the data model including dimensions and fact tables.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.
- Other relevant files and documentation.

## Data Model

The data model consists of the following components:

### Dimensions

1. **dim_customers**: Contains details of all customers including anonymous users who used guest checkout.
2. **dim_channels**: Stores data related to different channels.
3. **dim_products**: Holds information about products.
4. **dim_date**: Stores date-related data.

### Fact Tables

1. **fct_purchase_history**: Records customers' order history.
2. **fct_visit_history**: Tracks customers' visit history.

## Development Process

1. **Model Definition**: Define the data model including dimensions and fact tables in YAML format under the `models/` directory.
2. **Validation**: Validate the data model for correctness, completeness, and consistency.
3. **Implementation**: Implement the data model in the chosen database system, ensuring proper schema design and indexing for performance.
4. **Data Loading**: Load data into the warehouse from various sources such as transactional databases, CSV files, APIs, etc.
5. **Testing**: Test the data warehouse to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and performance.
6. **Documentation**: Document the data warehouse schema, ETL processes, and any other relevant information.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the data warehouse to the production environment.
